# ‚òï Coffee Components ‚Äî Roblox Plugin
-# (Coffee-Components-Plugin)

**Turn any selected Instances into reusable `Instance.new()` module code.**  
Build Roblox interfaces (and pretty much anything) the *React way* ‚Äî modular, declarative, and fast.

---

## üí° What It Does

Coffee Components lets you **convert selected Instances into Luau modules** that recreate them using `Instance.new()`.  
Once generated, you can reuse them just like React components - create, customize, and render UI (or other objects) directly from code.

> Example: Select a GUI button in Roblox Studio ‚Üí turn it into a component (All of the GUI button's properties, descendants and descendant's properties will be saved, so it can be styled - that's the main point of the plugin) ‚Üí call it from your scripts to generate buttons dynamically without manually referencing paths or worrying about `Infinite yield` warnings.

## üß© Technical Notes

The Entry Point is [EveryInstanceProperty.lua](https://github.com/Coffilhg/Coffee-Components-Plugin/blob/main/CoffeeComponents/EveryInstanceProperty.lua); everything else is a ModuleScript .

Some Instance Classes don‚Äôt replicate perfectly:
- **Scripts, LocalScripts and ModuleScripts** will only be copied without their Content, because Content property cannot be set during runtime - only Plugins/Roblox/Manual Input has permission to do so.
- **MeshParts and Custom Textures (BasePart.MaterialVariant)** may not transfer correctly due to Roblox replication limitations (Again, some properties might not be set in a usual way during runtime).
- You‚Äôre free to modify the plugin to fit your needs, following the [MIT-License](https://github.com/Coffilhg/Coffee-Components-Plugin/blob/main/LICENSE)
